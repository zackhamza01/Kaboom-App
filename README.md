#Prototype Music Application

##Purpose

**What will my application do?**
- This application will allow users to create *playlists*
- Users can insert *songs* into the playlist of their choice
- Users can play songs by adding a playlist to the queue
- A song that is not in any of the user's playlist can also be added to the queue

**Who will use it?**
- People that listen to *music* will want to use this application
- Individuals who want to listen to music in the background or as a way to *multitask* (ex: users who listen to music at the gym, college students, etc)

**Why is this project of use to you?**
- This is a good opportunity for me to show *future employers* what my coding capabilities are
- This project can potentially be a stepping stone for my career in application development
